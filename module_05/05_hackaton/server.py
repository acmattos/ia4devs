"""
    server for architecture detection.
    This server is used to detect architecture components in an image.
    It uses the ArchitectureDetectionService to detect the components and generate a report.
    It also uses the TempFileHandler to save the uploaded image to a temporary file.
    It then cleans up the temporary file after the detection is complete.

    Args:
        image: The image to detect the architecture components in.

    Returns:
        A JSON object with the following fields:
        - success: A success message.
        - detections: The number of architecture components detected.
        - report_generated: A boolean indicating if the report was generated.
        - markdown_report: The complete markdown report content for the Telegram agent.
        - error: An error message if the detection fails.

    Example:
        curl -X POST -F "image=@path/to/image.jpg" -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" http://localhost:8000/architecture-detect

    Example response:
        {
            "success": "Architecture detection completed successfully!",
            "detections": 10,
            "report_generated": true,
            "markdown_report": "# Threat Model Report\n\nGerado automaticamente\n\n## Component A (image.jpg)\n- **Confiança:** 0.85\n..."
        }
